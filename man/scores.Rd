\description{
Expected data frame format for scores.
}
\details{
The expected scores format is the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item{\emph{region_id} - unique numeric region identifier, reserving 0 as the region_id for the area-weighted average of the entire study area}
  \item{\emph{goal} - the goal code or Index}
  \item{\emph{dimension} - the dimension code, one of: status, trend, pressures, resilience, future, score}
  \item{\emph{score} - the numeric score: 0-100 for all dimensions, except trend (-1 to 1)}
}
To get the wide view (many columns, with one row per region and columns having combination of goal and dimension),
use something like: \code{reshape2::dcast(.self$long, region_id ~ goal + dimension, value.var='score')}.
