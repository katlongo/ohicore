\usage{
CalculatePressuresMatrix(alpha, beta, calc = "avg")
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{the weighting matrix of the form [category x pressure]. Each
rank weight must be an integer between 0 and 3 inclusive, or NA.}

\item{beta}{the aggregation matrix of the form [region_id x category] to
collapse across each category.}

\item{calc}{type of calculation, whether avg (default), mean (diff't from
avg?) or presence (results in 1 or 0).}
}
\value{
Returns a weight matrix \emph{w} [region_id x pressure] suitable
for \code{\link{CalculatePressuresScore}}.
}
\description{
The pressures matrix model function computes a pressures weighting matrix
based on regional attributes per category.
}
\details{
Given:

\itemize{

\item \emph{g} is the goal or subgoal (e.g., AO, CW, LIV, ECO, ...), \item
\emph{i} is the region (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...), \item \emph{j} is the
pressures layer or stressor (e.g., \code{cc_acid}, \code{fp_art_lb}, etc.).
\item \emph{k} is the category (e.g., habitat, sector, product, etc.)

}

There may be a component \emph{k} for a given goal \emph{g} such that
\eqn{p_w(g,i,j,k)} and \eqn{w(g,i,j,k)}.

\deqn{p_{w}(g,i,j,k) = w(g,i,j,k) * p(i,j)}

In these cases where there is a component \emph{k} for goal \emph{g},
there's an additional aggregation or formula to calculate \eqn{w(g,i,j)}
based on the core rank weight \eqn{\alpha(g,j,k)} from the original
pressures matrix (as written in Halpern et al. (2012)) and some
region-specific data for each category \code{k} \eqn{\beta(i,k)}.

This function \code{CalculatePressuresMatrix} will aggregate a
category-specific weighting matrix \eqn{\alpha(g,j,k)} [category x
pressure] using region-specific data \eqn{\beta(g,i,k)} into a [region_id x
pressure] matrix \eqn{w(g,i,j)} used in \code{CalculatePressuresScore}, such
that:

\deqn{w(g,i,j) = \frac{\sum_k \alpha({g,j,k}) * \beta({g,i,k})}{\sum_k
\beta({g,i,k})}}

\enumerate{

\item For the CP, CS goals, the weight depends on the extent \emph{A} of
habitat \emph{k} in region \emph{i}:

\deqn{\beta(i,k) = A(i,k)}

\item For the HAB goal, the weight depends on the presence of habitat
\emph{k} (i.e., if \eqn{A(i,k)>0}) in region \emph{i}:

\deqn{\beta(i,k) = hasHabitat(i,k)}

\item For the LIV and ECO goals, the weight depends on the presence of
sector \emph{k} if data available for region \emph{i} and sector \emph{k}:

\deqn{\beta(i,k) = hasSector(i,k)}

\item For the NP goal, the weight depends on the peak dollar value of each
product \emph{k} across all years (see \eqn{w_p} from SI Equation S27) if
data available for region \emph{i} and product \emph{k}:

\deqn{\beta(i,k) = w_p(i,k)} }
